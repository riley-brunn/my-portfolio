    Nice to meet you! I'm Riley, a creative interested in working in the fields of web design and development. While I currently reside in Orlando, I was born and raised on the east
    coast of Florida. Growing up, I had a dual fascination with both the arts
    and various scientific disciplines. Cultivating a diverse range of
    knowledge, I've studied technology, biological sciences, business, and the
    fine arts throughout my academic career. I have a passion for both the
    design and technical aspects of web and mobile apps, with a focus on
    creating fun and interesting visuals. I'm excited to share these passions
    with others in my future work and career.

              Rescue-Trac is a concept for a pet-finder app. This was done as a group project where I worked as the team lead and the main UI/UX designer. It was created for a User-Centered Design class, and the purpose of the assignment was to take an idea for a mobile app from a basic flowchart of ideas to a hi-fi interactive prototype. Throughout the course of this semester-long project, I learned many important UX protocols and methods, as well as ways to gather and implement user feedback.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text indent">The app's main purposes are to help users find pets to adopt and to help other users find lost pets. Key features are:</p>
            <ul class="card-ul">
              <li>Notifications</li>
              <li>The ability to follow rescue shelters and foster homes that the user is interested in</li>
              <li>A button on pet profiles to message the shelter directly in the app</li>
              <li>A button on lost/found pet posts to message the owner/finder of a pet directly in the app</li>
              <li>Optional inclusion of a telephone link for pet profiles or posts</li>
              <li>Bookmarking functionality to save a list of pet profiles a user is interested in</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text indent">
              The color scheme is playful and friendly while maintaining a calm atmosphere. The teals and greens provide a feeling of tranquility while the orange accents brighten up the palette and provide a contrast to the cooler hues.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text indent">
              Icons such as the filter and the user represent expected functionality for better user experience. Touch targets are kept large enough to prevent misclicks and color contrast is demonstrated for good accessibility.

              Social Platform Concept
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Concept:</b> This endeavor helped me learn more about how
              social media sites are put together. The mobile app would be
              called "Audiophile", which would take inspiration from other
              platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. It would be a place for
              music-lovers to discuss different genres, share playlists,
              recommend new artists, and discuss new releases. Some of the
              app's features would include live-streaming, event-organizing,
              and Sub-Hubs, which are similar to Reddit's concept of
              subreddits.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Imagery:</b> logo drawn in Ibis Paint X. An audiophile is
              someone who is enthusiastic about recording and listening to
              high-fidelity music. The logo I designed is a stylized version
              of a vinyl record, which is not just a common symbol of music
              but also a popular listening medium among audiophiles, making it
              a good pick for the app's logo. The color scheme includes red
              because of it's symbolism of passion and excitement, which are
              common feelings people have when listening to and talking about
              their favorite music.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Interface:</b> Designed in Picsart. The top app bar includes
              a profile button, the app logo, and a side drawer. The bottom
              tab bar includes buttons for the home feed, search/discovery
              page, post creation, livestreaming, and messages. The design is high contrast, which is beneficial for the app's style goals and for accessibility.

              This app design utilizes a lively interface for completing an often
              boring activity. To keep better track of their tasks,
              users can make an account for use across devices.
              Demostrated features in mockup:

              a calendar to set due dates and the ability to filter and edit

              a way for the timer to count up or down depending on the user's

        While I was creating this project, I had trouble with sorting the list
        of entries. I was trying to replace the original list with the sorted
        version, but I couldn't figure out which method was best for removing
        the entries and replacing them with a different ordered list. I ended
        up using a while loop, the hasChildNodes() method, and removeChild()
        methods to remove the old list and used appendChild() and
        insertAdjacentElement() to add the new list.

        This gave me a good understanding of different math calculations
        within programming for real-life applications. I also got a good grasp
        on how to do other things such as animate images and customize
        drop-down lists.

        This app let's users take a simple geography quiz and optionally
        submit some information along with it.

        In the making of this project, I was struggling with adding the input
        hints in the proper places. I also had trouble displaying the correct symbol to show
        whether the input was valid or needed to be fixed. In order to make it
        work, I placed a span tag to the right of each input box and, with
        JavaScript, used a switch statement to decide which hint text node it
        should insert into which span. The hint is offered when the input box
        is focused and the input is validated when the box is blurred.

        Developing this app gave me a better grasp on making online quizzes, which
        involve conditional logic and incrementing values to total a score. It
        also helped me figure out how to give hints for filling in different
        types of input without visually overwhelming or confusing the user.

    While I currently reside in Orlando, I was born and raised on the east
    coast of Florida. Growing up, I had a dual fascination with both the arts
    and various scientific disciplines. Cultivating a diverse range of
    knowledge, I've studied technology, biological sciences, business, and the
    fine arts throughout my academic career. I have a passion for both the
    design and technical aspects of web and mobile apps, with a focus on
    creating fun and interesting visuals. I'm excited to share these passions
    with others in my future work and career.

              FlashDeck would be beneficial to people who need to study and
              like to stay organized. The app would allow users to create
              decks of flashcards and flip through the cards to study them.
              Features would include:
            </p>
            <ul class="card-ul">
              <li>Creating, editing, and deleting cards and decks</li>
              <li>Studying the cards in sequence or shuffling them</li>
              <li>Color coding and titling decks</li>
              <li>
                Editable front and back of cards to separate prompt/question
                from answer
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text">
              The color scheme gives the app a lighter and less daunting look,
              which is done to ease the user's possible stress surrounding
              studying. Orange is used as an accent color because it tends to
              represent confidence and optimism, both feelings that this app
              hopes to invoke.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Button shapes closely resemble ones used in other apps for
              familiarity's sake. Their touch targets are also large enough to avoid misclicks. Shuffling the cards makes the answers harder
              to predict. Color coding the decks helps users distinguish them
              better and gives the app a more fun feel.

              Social Platform Concept
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Concept:</b> This endeavor helped me learn more about how
              social media sites are put together. The mobile app would be
              called "Audiophile", which would take inspiration from other
              platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. It would be a place for
              music-lovers to discuss different genres, share playlists,
              recommend new artists, and discuss new releases. Some of the
              app's features would include live-streaming, event-organizing,
              and Sub-Hubs, which are similar to Reddit's concept of
              subreddits.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Imagery:</b> logo drawn in Ibis Paint X. An audiophile is
              someone who is enthusiastic about recording and listening to
              high-fidelity music. The logo I designed is a stylized version
              of a vinyl record, which is not just a common symbol of music
              but also a popular listening medium among audiophiles, making it
              a good pick for the app's logo. The color scheme includes red
              because of it's symbolism of passion and excitement, which are
              common feelings people have when listening to and talking about
              their favorite music.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Interface:</b> Designed in Picsart. The top app bar includes
              a profile button, the app logo, and a side drawer. The bottom
              tab bar includes buttons for the home feed, search/discovery
              page, post creation, livestreaming, and messages. The design is high contrast, which is beneficial for the app's style goals and for accessibility.

        While I was creating this project, I had trouble with sorting the list
        of entries. I was trying to replace the original list with the sorted
        version, but I couldn't figure out which method was best for removing
        the entries and replacing them with a different ordered list. I ended
        up using a while loop, the hasChildNodes() method, and removeChild()
        methods to remove the old list and used appendChild() and
        insertAdjacentElement() to add the new list.
      </p>

        In the making of this project, I was struggling with adding the input
        hints in the proper places and displaying the correct symbol to show
        whether the input was valid or needed to be fixed. In order to make it
        work, I placed a span tag to the right of each input box and, with
        JavaScript, used a switch statement to decide which hint text node it
        should insert into which span. The hint is offered when the input box
        is focused and the input is validated when the box is blurred.
      </p>
      <p class="dev-txt subheading indent">
        Developing this app gave me a better grasp of making quizzes, which
        involve conditional logic and incrementing values to total a score. It
        also helped me figure out how to give hints for filling in different
        types of input without visually overwhelming or confusing the user.

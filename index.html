      I'm Riley, a creative interested in working in the
      fields of web design and development. While I currently reside in Orlando,
      I was born and raised on the east coast of Florida. Growing up, I had a
      dual fascination with both the arts and various scientific disciplines.
      Cultivating a diverse range of knowledge, I've studied technology,
      biological sciences, business, and the fine arts throughout my academic
      career. I have a passion for both the design and technical aspects of web
      and mobile apps, with a focus on creating fun and interesting visuals. I'm
      excited to share these passions with others in my future work and career.

                Rescue-Trac is a concept for a pet-finder app. This was created
                as a group project where I worked as the team lead and the main
                UI/UX designer. My final and biggest contribution was creating
                the hi-fi design and prototype, which I have linked below.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text indent">
                This product was created for a User-Centered Design class, and
                the purpose of the assignment was to take an idea for a mobile
                app from a basic flowchart of ideas to a hi-fi interactive
                prototype. Throughout the course of this semester-long project,
                I learned many important UX protocols and methods, as well as
                ways to gather and implement user feedback.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text indent">
                The app's main purposes are to help users find pets to adopt and
                to help other users find lost pets. Key features are:
              </p>
              <ul class="card-ul">
                <li>Notifications</li>
                <li>
                  The ability to follow rescue shelters and foster homes that
                  the user is interested in
                </li>
                <li>
                  A button on pet profiles to message the shelter directly in

                </li>
                <li>
                  A button on lost/found pet posts to message the owner/finder
                  of a pet directly in the app
                </li>
                <li>
                  Optional inclusion of a telephone link for pet profiles or
                  posts
                </li>
                <li>

                The color scheme is playful and friendly while maintaining a
                calm atmosphere. The teals and greens provide a feeling of
                tranquility while the orange accents brighten up the palette and
                provide a contrast to the cooler hues.

                Icons such as the filter and the user represent expected

                demonstrated for good accessibility.

                Social Platform Concept
              </h3>
              <p class="card-text">
                This was from an assignment I did in a Social Platforms course.
                I was tasked with making a concept for a social media app,
                designing some core pages, and then creating a site that
                advertised it and highlighted its key features.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Concept:</b> This endeavor helped me learn more about how
                social media sites are put together. The mobile app would be
                called "Audiophile", which would take inspiration from other
                platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. It would be a place for
                music-lovers to discuss different genres, share playlists,
                recommend new artists, and discuss new releases. Some of the
                app's features would include live-streaming, event-organizing,
                and Sub-Hubs, which are similar to Reddit's concept of
                subreddits.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Imagery:</b> An audiophile is someone who is enthusiastic
                about recording and listening to high-fidelity music. The logo I
                illustrated in Ibis Paint X is a stylized version of a vinyl
                record. This is not only a common symbol of music but also a
                popular listening medium among audiophiles, making it a good
                pick for the app's logo. The color scheme includes red because
                of it's symbolism of passion and excitement. These are common
                feelings people have when listening to and talking about their
                favorite music, making this color scheme really resonate with

                <b>Interface:</b> These screens were designed in Picsart. The
                top app bar includes a profile button, the app logo, and a side
                drawer. The bottom tab bar includes buttons for the home feed,
                discovery page, post creation, livestreaming, and messages. The
                design is high contrast, which is beneficial for accessibility.

                I completed this piece for a User-Centered Design course. It was an individual assignment created to demonstrate my wireframing and prototyping skills as a precursor to a bigger project.

              <p class="card-text indent">
                This illustrates a concept for an art-based social platform. I designed it for an Android screen since I usually end up designing for iPhone and wanted some variety.
                The screens shown include:
              </p>
              <ul class="card-ul">
                <li>a Home page displaying the communities a user is a member of. Users can join and contribute to many different themed communities on the platform</li>
                <li>
                  A Discover page with a search bar and an image grid of user posts. The posts gathered here are based on the user's interests
                </li>
                <li>
                  a Notifications page
                </li>
                <li>a Profile page that includes a grid of the user's posts</li>
                <li>a Messages page</li>
                <li>a splash screen</li>
                <li>a Settings page</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="card-text indent">
                Purple is chosen as the primary color because of its symbolism of creativity. Since yellow is its complementary color, it provides contrast to the cooler primary color.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text indent">
                The layout is reminiscent to other social media interfaces for a familiar user experience. Buttons have large touch targets for better usability and accessibility. Different font weights are used for visual interest and better visual clarity.

                I made this for my recent Mobile Development course. Similar to
                my to-do app assignment discussed previously, the precursor to
                this was a simple React Native app.

              <p class="card-text indent">
                This design of an exercise app holds all the benefits of a
                traditional workout interface while including other features
                such as a fun design, options to add weight to certain
                exercises, and a way for the timer to count up or down depending
                on the user's needs. There is also a way to record each workout
                in a log. It is simplistic and expresses good shape and color
                variety. Demostrated features in this visual include:
              </p>
              <ul class="card-ul">
                <li>
                  An option for the timer on the second plank screen to count up
                  or down from a specified point when the kebab menu button is
                  pressed
                </li>
                <li>
                  A time picker on the third plank screen is revealed when the
                  Timer box is pressed
                </li>
                <li>
                  Indication of recording in progress on the second push-ups
                  screen

                <li>
                  A selection box to add weight on the third push-ups screen
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="card-text indent">
                Orange is used because it represents energy and excitement,
                demonstrating the app's intended atmosphere. The bottom tab bar
                will be visually familiar to users, which is helpful for the
                app's usability.

          While I was creating this project, I had trouble with sorting the list
          of entries. I was trying to replace the original list with the sorted
          version, but I couldn't figure out which method was best for removing
          the entries and replacing them with a different ordered list. I ended
          up using a while loop, the hasChildNodes() method, and removeChild()
          methods to remove the old list and used appendChild() and
          insertAdjacentElement() to add the new list.
        </p>
        <p class="dev-txt subheading indent">
          This gave me a good understanding of different math calculations
          within programming for real-life applications. I also got a good grasp
          on how to do other things such as animate images and customize
          drop-down lists.

          In the making of this project, I was struggling with adding the input
          hints in the proper places. I also had trouble displaying the correct
          symbol to show whether the input was valid or needed to be fixed. In
          order to make it work, I placed a span tag to the right of each input
          box and, with JavaScript, used a switch statement to decide which hint
          text node it should insert into which span. The hint is offered when
          the input box is focused and the input is validated when the box is
          blurred.
        </p>
        <p class="dev-txt subheading indent">
          Developing this app gave me a better grasp on making online quizzes,
          which involve conditional logic and incrementing values to total a
          score. It also helped me figure out how to give hints for filling in
          different types of input without visually overwhelming or confusing
          the user.

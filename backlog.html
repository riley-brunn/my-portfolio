            I made this in a Client-Side Scripting course as a final project.
            The app lets users take a simple geography quiz and optionally
            submit some identifying information along with it. I utilized HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript in this project. Notable skills used include
            form validation and conditional logic. The design includes a right
            sidebar for ad space or other extra content.

            In the making of this project, I was struggling with adding the
            input hints in the proper places. I also had trouble displaying the
            correct symbol to show whether the input was valid or needed to be
            fixed. In order to make it work, I placed a span tag to the right of
            each input box and, with JavaScript, used a switch statement to
            decide which hint text node it should insert into which span. The
            hint is offered when the input box is focused and the input is
            validated when the box is blurred.
          </p>
          <p class="indent text-start">
            Developing this app gave me a better grasp on making online quizzes,
            which involve conditional logic and incrementing values to total a
            score. It also helped me figure out how to give hints for filling in
            different types of input without visually overwhelming or confusing
            the user.
